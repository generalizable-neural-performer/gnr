## Overview
GeneBody is a new dataset that
we collected to evaluate the generalization and robustness of human novel view synthesis. It consists of over total *2.95M* frames of *100* subjects performing *370* sequences under *48* multi-view cameras capturing, with a variety of pose actions, in different types of body shapes, clothing, accessories and hairdos, ranging the geometry and appearance varies from everyday life to professional occasions.

## Annotations
GeneBody provides the per-view per-frame segmentation, using [BackgroundMatting-V2](https://github.com/PeterL1n/BackgroundMattingV2), and register the fitted [SMPLx](https://github.com/PeterL1n/BackgroundMattingV2) using our enhanced multi-view smplify repo in [here](). Annotation details can be found in the documentation [Annotation.md]()
